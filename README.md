# The-Hare-and-The-Turtle-Race

Goal: To familiarize ourselves with the concept of pointers, syntax of c++ and to develop the stimulation of famous Tortoise and Hare fable.
Input: 
* None.
Output:
* Print out the positions of tortoise and hare each time the dice is rolled and also prints the finish line in order to keep track of who reaches the finish line first.
Requirements:
* A Hare function that helps generating a random number by rolling dice so that hare can make its move following appropriate conditional statements.
* A Tortoise function that helps to generate a random number so that tortoise can make its move following conditional statements.
* A position function that helps to keep track of, update and print position of tortoise and hare each time the dice is rolled (move is made).
* Looping condition which ensures that the dice is rolled (move is made) as long as neither Hare nor the Tortoise reaches the finish line which is the race length.
